<h3>North Atlantic Bias Assessment</h3>
<p>
This diagnostic assesses the performance of a target ocean model simulation relative to observational benchmarks and an ensemble of CMIP6 OMIP simulations. It focuses on four key upper-ocean fields:

thetao_zavg: Potential temperature averaged over the upper 200 m

so_zavg: Salinity averaged over the upper 200 m

sigma0_zavg: Potential density anomaly averaged over the upper 200 m

mld: Mixed Layer Depth, calculated based on a sigma0 threshold

These variables are computed as climatological monthly means over the period 1989–2018, regridded to a common 1°×1° grid using bilinear interpolation via xESMF.

Key Plots and Interpretation
Plot1 (Spatial Maps): For each variable, the left panel shows bias (model – observations), while the right panel shows the bias rank, indicating how the target model compares to the distribution of CMIP6 OMIP models.

Colors in bias maps indicate whether the model is warmer/saltier/denser than observations.

Bias ranks are percentile-based; a higher value means the target model has one of the largest absolute biases among peers.

A green box highlights the focus region, where local bias statistics are computed.

Plot2 (Scatter Plot): Relates regional bias statistics between two variables (e.g., temperature vs. salinity) across all models, highlighting the performance of the target model.

The yellow star indicates the target model.

A best-fit line and Pearson correlation coefficient summarize the relationship.
